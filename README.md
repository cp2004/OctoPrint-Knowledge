# OctoPrint-Knowledge
Contains a bunch of useful scripts, configuration and instructions for developing plugins and core OctoPrint.

These are mostly just things I figured out myself, and thought it was worth writing down to save time in the future. If you have something to contribute, from typos to re-writing a whole guide, I'm more than happy to accept contributions to the guides here.
